* When using aframe, I see that I have to create and use a HTML files. To make a shape you will need to know the width, length, and hight of the shape you would like to create aswell as the color. Using afame you can animate the shape or object you made to go anyway you would want it to go. Afame also provides a vr like feeling when using it(https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/)I used this website to see examples on how many different people used Aframe and what they created.

* Now after seeing examples of afame and codes. I will try and make somthing on my own when using aframe, so i will make a sphere when using a-sphere position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="red" /a-sphere it creates a red sphere at a position of "-1, 0.5, -3", and also the sphere is rotated at an angle of "0, 45, 0".I used a-sky color="lightblue" /a-sky to make the sky around the sphere light-blue.

* I try to see different avaiable shapes which are "box, circle, cone, cylinder, plane, triangle, ring".to see if  could make a object that I would want to make.I watched this video to see a tutorial of Afame (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KjyTU07EHo).Models come in the format of plain text files containing vertices, faces, UVs, textures, materials, and animations. They also come with images for textures, usually alongside the model file. three.js loaders parse these files to render them within a three.js scene as meshes. A-Frame model components wrap these three.js loaders.
