* When using aframe, I see that I have to create and use a HTML files. To make a shape you will need to know the width, length, and hight of the shape you would like to create aswell as the color. Using afame you can animate the shape or object you made to go anyway you would want it to go. Afame also provides a vr like feeling when using it.
[https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/] I used this website to see examples on how many different people used Aframe and what they created.

* Now after seeing examples of afame and codes. I will try and make somthing on my own when using aframe, when using a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" /a-box it creates a blue box[#4CC3D9] at position "-1, 0.5, -3".That is rotated at "0, 45, 0".
