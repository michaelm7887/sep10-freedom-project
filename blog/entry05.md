When I was learning my tool(A-frame) for my freedom project I split the learning parts for 3 days.The 1st day was to ;look at examples of A-frame coding to have a better understanding. And for the 2nd day I had to aleast try using A-frame for myself to help expand my learning more, so I used jsbin and my IDE to make my own A-frame coding and so then I created my own little coding tinker of making a funny face using some of the avaible shapes A-frame has to offer.And lastly for the 3rd day I finished up my tinkering coding for my A-frame tool that I will be using for my freedom project.
